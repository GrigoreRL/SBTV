# SBTV - Simple Boris Trajectory Viewer

SBTV is a simple application for the visualization of charged particle trajectories. 

For computations, it relies on the code of SBPP. 

To run SBTV using the code present here, simply download the entire repository and run the command

"python mainFile.py" 

in your Python environment. This should start up the application.

SBTV was developed as part of my Bachelor thesis in Physics at the University of Groningen.
